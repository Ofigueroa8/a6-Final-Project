# a6-Final-Project
1. Choose a dataset.
2. Determine which algorithm is the best fit. Based on the dataset you choose, you will need to figure out which algorithm to use. This will require you to get to know your data and your goals! Is there a linear correlation between variables? Are you looking for numerical value or a label/category? Do you know the labels or do you need the model to create them for you?
- Do some tests with matplotlib and visualize your data.  Does it provide a good correlation?  Why or why not?
3. Program your model. Once you have chosen your type of model, itâ€™s time to create it! In this step, you will write a program that fits your chosen model to the data. Your program and output will be specific to the model you choose.  
4. Analyze and present your findings. An important part of creating predictive models is being able to communicate the results. In this final step of the project, you will present your findings using slides or an infographic. Your product should include the following components:
- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose
the reason we choose the multi variable model was because our dayaset had multiple factors that could have been used to determine the price of the house so we decided to make a mdel that checks the correlation between each variable and the price.
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean?
our model showed that the age of a house does not really have a significant corrolation to the price of the house, our model also shows that the factor that has the highest correlation to the price of the house is the distance the house is from the nearest train station and as tha distance increases the price of the house goes down. Finally our model shows that the only factor with a positive correlation to the price of the house is the number of convinience stores located around the house.
- A prediction based on your model
A house with that is 20 years old, 870 meters from the nearest train station, and has 5 convenience stores nearby would be valued at 39.29 Ping per 3.3 meter squared.
- A summary of the accuracy of your model
Our model is not very accurate because none of the variables have a correlation above 70 percent this shouws that aside from the 3 variable we checked other factors also play a significant part in deciding the price of a house. It probably could've been better if we used all of the variables to determine the price of the house and see if that would have a better prediction of the price.
- Real world implications
Our model, although not accurate, could be used by construction or realestate companies to design a negiboorhood in a way that maximizes the amount people are willing to pay to live in that neighboorhood. It's a useful model and use of data because buying houses is quite a common thing so it's great to have predictions based on previous data.
